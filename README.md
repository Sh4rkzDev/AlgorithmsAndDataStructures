# Algorithms & Data Structures

Subject of Computer Engineering at Faculty of Engineering of Buenos Aires. Its purpose is to understand how different types of structures work, and start to abstract from its implementation when they are used.

The language used was Go, and the projects that had been developed was all useful for server-side knowledge.

To test all the features and projects, you must have Go installed in your computer, and run the following commands in the terminal: 

```
go work init
go work use tdas
go work use tp1
go work use tp2
go work use tp3
go mod tidy
```

The `go work init` will create a workspace that is going to be useful for connecting all the modules and packages.
Then, all you have to do is to move to the project you would like to test and run `go test`. Specifications can be found in the README.md of the project.
